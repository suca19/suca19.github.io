    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p><i>Purple Rain</i> is a song by American musician Prince and his backing
      band The Revolution. It is the title track
      from the 1984 album of the same name, which in turn is the soundtrack
      album for the 1984 film of the same name.</p>

    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>Originally written as a country song and intended to be a collaboration
      with Stevie Nicks, Prince explained the
      meaning of the song as follows: <i>"When there's blood in the sky... red
        and blue = purple. Purple rain pertains to
        the end of the world and being with the one you love and letting your
        faith/god guide you through the purple
        rain."<i></i></i></p><i><i>

        <h2>Recording</h2>
        <p>The song was recorded during a benefit concert for the Minnesota
          Dance Theatre at the First Avenue nightclub in
          Minneapolis on August 3, 1983. <i>City Pages</i> described the
          70-minute performance as Prince's "sweatiest and
          most soulful hometown concert yet."</p>

        <h2>Reception and legacy</h2>
        <p>The song ranked number 144 on the Rolling Stone list of the 500
          Greatest Songs of All Time. Q magazine placed
          it at number 40 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks, and
          Pitchfork named it the best song of the
          1980s. The song is also included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's
          500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.</p>
